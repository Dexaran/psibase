# Introduction

Contract Lab (clsdk) is a set of tools and libraries for building, testing, and debugging smart contracts for Mandel. It has the following capabilities:

* Compile contracts for Mandel 3.0, eosio 2.0, and earlier
* Debug contracts using the `debug_plugin`, which comes built in to Contract Lab's `nodeos` executable
* Create deterministic tests using `cltester`, which comes with Contract Lab
* Debug contracts and tests using `cltester`
* Bootstrap test chains using `cltester` and spawn a `nodeos` producer on them
* Fork public chains into test chains
