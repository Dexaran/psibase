# If you're using VSCode

The default files for both c_cpp_properties.json and tasks.json are provided and end in ".sample". To use them, duplicate them inside the .vscode directory, and rename the duplicates to remove the trailing ".sample" from the filename. Your actual c_cpp_properties.json and tasks.json files should not be checked into source control, allowing you to customize them to meet your local development needs.

These two files will allow your IDE to provide two capabilities to enhance developer experience:

1. Better intellisense
2. Buttons on the UI to aid in building/testing your services.

## Getting build/test UI buttons

Ensure `actboy168.tasks` extension is installed, and then define the relevant build tasks in tasks.json. This extension allows tasks defined in tasks.json to be bound to buttons on the blue taskbar at the bottom of the VSCode IDE.

## Getting Intellisense

To get c++ intellisense to work properly, you will need to set the compileCommands field in the c_cpp_properties.json. The compile_commands.json file will be automatically generated by cmake.
